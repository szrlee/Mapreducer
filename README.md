## Map Reducer
This is yet another lightweight implementation of map reduce framework based on P2P distributed storage system. 

## Example
We implement a instance for weather data processing based on this framework.

You can find a list of weather data in the *Testmap* directory.

## How to test
1. modify the *ip* parameter in the function of *start_client()* in client.py and map.py.
2. run client.py and map.py on corresponding client and server sides.

## Just for fun
We implement this framework just for learning and interest.
Therefore, no guarantee on the stability of this framework.
Report bug on issue if you would like to.
